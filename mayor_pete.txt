McKinsey Pete's for democracy when it comes to overturning Citizens United, but not when it involves criticizing his corp lobbyist friends' support for the pvt over the common good. Nor does he say much abt the role the billionaire class plays in subverting democracy.

#Buttigieg would just be Obama 2.0
I like him claiming back the word ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù It‚Äôs been tainted by the right. It doesn‚Äôt currently mean what it sound mean #Buttigieg #MayorPete
I have to say when he said ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù was going to be one of his 3 pillars, it had me worried, but I like that explanation. I like Climate Security concept because it‚Äôs life or death if we don‚Äôt do something #PeteForAmerica #Buttigieg

Innate, Calm Confidence.

He could take trump on. Wouldn't get rattled. Would take the #moral , intelligent route.Make trump look like a fool. 

Surprised I'm getting this enthusiastic. Doesn't happen often.
@MET4094 An interesting and smart move by #Buttigieg, I think, possibly of interest to both an @MayorJenny Durkan and an @MET4094 Connie Durkin. Continue to be a fan of your insightful tweets on things which often have not received the attention they should have, @KellyO. https://t.co/V4ktcBgfUC
Sounds like #MayorPete is more interested in winning a debate with #MikePence/#evangelicals, than in winning an #election.  Revealingly, no section on his website yet on his stance on the issues:  https://t.co/sIRfieEcSJ #election2020 #Democrats #Buttigieg https://t.co/ihjVkQYLzE

Interesting contrast between yesterday's #Booker rally in Newark and today's #Buttigieg rally in South Bend. Booker's was long on color and diversity. Buttieg's is monochromatic.
Under Bill Clinton, the presidency was downgraded to a super-sized governor (read to school kids, sign symbolic bills in Rose Garden). Would #Buttigieg downgrade it further -- to super-sized mayor?

Pete wants to talk to ALL the people of America.

@MidlyFree @ndrew_lawrence When it became a slogan to counter ‚Äòblack lives matter‚Äô, the phrase ‚Äòall lives matter‚Äô took on a new meaning. Pete refers to the revised meaning; Fox News knows that but would rather have you think he‚Äôs racist. He‚Äôs not, of course. #freedom #liberty #Democracy #Buttigieg #Veteran

If Mayor Pete #Buttigieg becomes #president in 2020 he would be unique. He would be the youngest, 1st openly gay but 2nd gay president, married to Chasten Glezman (middle school teacher &amp; male husband),  war vet, Harvard/Oxford grad, Rhodes scholar, wife but not female pres? üòè https://t.co/2vEoONvO3m

The story of the #2020Elections is women.  Not women in the role of smiling, supportive spouse or vapid veep, but the straight up candidates. But you know who we're talking about? #Bernie, #Beto, and #Buttigieg. @MSNBC and @CNN especially, you need to do better.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg Responds to the Vice President's Criticism https://t.co/zv3HbsHoZB via @YouTube I'm not one who typically posts anything from TV, least of all Ellen.. Her guest #Buttigieg, though, is *eloquent*, esp. on the lovely topic of gender diversity.
@maddow so glad you're having @PeteButtigieg on #maddow on Monday. It's been a long time since I've been so impressed re any candidate and want to learn as much as possible about him. Really looking forward to this interview! #msnbc #Buttigieg

But "laws" can also be easily hidden behind as justification to not do the right thing. This is what King was addressing. How does this relate to #Buttigieg ? When he said "all lives matter" he was also hiding behind "the law" to avoid releasing tapes that directly 4/
Everyone's focused on #Buttigieg 's  "all lives matter" comment. He's going to get a pass from the media and white progressives because "he's learned and stopped saying it". But has the thinking underneath changed? This is what #MLK spoke about in re: white "moderates" 1/ https://t.co/3bqCkApix8
So #Buttigieg was more concerned with "the law" which in this case was more concerned with protecting the police engaged in racism ( some would argue and I'd agree, working as designed) than addressing the racism. And this is also what #MLK spoke about 6/
This is the type of voter #Buttigieg thinks is reachable.

Running for US House of Representatives in 2010, I had the great privilege to appear with Peter #Buttigieg who was then a candidate for #Indiana State Treasurer. We are only separated by Mourdock in this Hendricks County profile. https://t.co/45z2Ha0Qqc #Buttigieg2020
you have to like this guy...his turn of phrase is so people friendly and filled with reason in our most unreasonable times.  Maybe he can persuade a few to come over to the fair side.  #Buttigieg #NewWorldOrder https://t.co/bI5CZXeQfQ

#Buttigieg is judgemental &amp; self-righteous without noticing it violates the 'humble man' image he's trying to push. #VPPence actually is a humble man who does NOT push his beliefs on others, unlike Buttigieg
https://t.co/oDSWpmG99x
So called 'humble' Buttigieg sure is a self-righteous narcissist who judges everyone else. Odd, tho, that Pence is a quiet believer instead of pushing his beliefs on everyone as does #Buttigieg.

@RealSaavedra ...tough to take #Buttigieg seriously about this, when his father was a Marxist professor who praised the Communist manifesto...
@RealSaavedra #Buttigieg looks ridiculous fighting the faux #Pence boogeyman. He‚Äôs using faith as a tool to garner Trump votes, hoping #Christians are too stupid to reconcile his religious hypocrisy on late term #abortion.

#Biden is a proxy for white Dem good-will toward Obama.

#Sanders' lack of dominance means he is no longer the standard-bearer for millennial socialism.

@EWErickson #Buttigieg is a typical #democrat. He is using #Christian faith to promote his own #political agenda and the bonus is he can drag in someone like @VP who is trying to live his faith, not create it.
@sherrilee7 His comments brought tears to my eyes, paralleling the experience / fears of someone very close to me raised in a Christian home. I hope people see him for the views and person he is, what he can bring to the table, not just solely carrying the label of his sexuality #Buttigieg

The same press that calls Pete Brilliant but calls women like Warren a "scold"

1/2 As a completely committed #Beto2020 supporter, I find the #MayorPete candidacy incredibly compelling. I absolutely will be campaigning/supporting #BetoFor46 but both #Buttigieg &amp; #Beto have a multitude of values/qualities/perspectives that I genuinely admire.
2/2 #Beto &amp; #Buttigieg know that mobilizing an inspired citizenry to exercise a collective voice combined w/real structural change are the only pathways to transformational policies ever being enacted. Values/Systemic Thinking &gt; Utopian Policy Positions https://t.co/gZz24MxUnZ
1/2 #Beto &amp; #Buttigieg are both spot on about philosophy/values preceding #policy prescriptions. Ideologues=BlueSkyThinking if they believe campaign policy papers will ever become an unaltered reality. We live in a divided democracy not in an absolute monarchy #NoMagicWandsInUSA

#Buttigieg His abnormal sexual orientation is more of a threat than Global Warming.  The more people who go untreated for this psycho disorder and the more its normalized by our society, the more likely humans go extinct in the future.  His lastname would bring endless jokes.
#Buttigieg Americans are not going to put two more gay men in the White House; even after admitting it up front.  They have a psychological disorder and the sooner people realize that the sooner we can help people like them.   Lusting over the same sex is abnormal behavior.
#Buttigieg out for me, way too religious. I have had more than enough of the nonsense in our countries leaders.

#PeteButtigieg ‚Äòs rise electrifies the gay community, but he could face a rocky road to the Presidency. My personal Opinion is that #Buttigieg is 100 times more qualified to be President than #Trump will ever be. - The Washington Post #LGBTQI https://t.co/KfmBP7gmpl
2/2 
From it: "... He is, quite simply, what many of us in my generation of gays fought for and rarely believed could happen: He is proud to be gay but not defined by it, happily married, a veteran, wickedly smart, and completely integrated." 
-Andrew Sullivan   #Buttigieg
Apparently #Buttigieg has never heard of irony of "living in a glass house."
Also, you should never bash voters in order to try and win them over.

The Left seeks to weaponize Scripture against the Church.

If @PeteButtigieg repents of his sodomy &amp; baby killing, we can work out Christendom, but no Christian should flinch at his hypocrisy.

3. The Laws of the OT need the WHOLE of the Covenant. For example, if Trump prevented Muslims from exercising their religious beliefs, #Buttigieg would conclude he's "oppressing" the "strangers," but OT Israel would prevent this.

Israel's Torah protected their social order.
1. Buttigieg confuses Church &amp; the State, although I'm sure he'd appeal to their separation. 

2. The State exists to execute wrath on evil doers/reward the good, not "wash feet," administer grace, esp via other peoples money, in the world.

Finding out my friends I respect most are also on the Mayor Pete train is a rush #Buttigieg
@politicalHEDGE ROFL...#Buttigieg stands for infanticide and he is doubting if Trump believes in God!

What a hypocritical idiot!
#Buttigieg Records show that minorities have left the force by the dozens. https://t.co/AGfdDS6S8x
@JohnLeguizamo Just putting out there! But what about #KamalaHarris2020 and #Buttigieg as vice! That's the ticket!  Fixed it for you. #Kamala2020
#BUTTIGIEG ? At least for VP? https://t.co/iaepKZui5K
@PeteButtigieg Tears

So proud. As a Gay man, watching this unfold is gold.

You're a fantastic candidate without the touching and powerful aspect of modern Gay married men!

Strange that #Hickenlooper no longer has the weirdest name of candidates for the #dem nomination now that #buttigieg has thrown his hat in the ring
@OsitaNwanevu The Cambridge dictionary defines charisma as ‚Äúthe ability to attract the attention and admiration of others, and to be seen as a leader.‚Äù So, yes, I find him very charismatic. #Buttigieg #Charisma #Smart #Leader
Democrats are more critical of #Israel's Continual Criminal Conduct. Not Pete #Buttigieg. https://t.co/SYVHwvkFXO via @voxdotcom

@CNN what did you ever see in @EWErickson ?
What a sad little fool he is. False claims about #Buttigieg
I'm in a #Buttigieg/Harris 2020 kinda mood
Too many people at @CurrierMuseum waiting for @PeteButtigieg &amp; @Chas10Buttigieg
turns out we needed an even bigger space!

People ask why everyone's so dismissive of Dem female presidential candidates, but not the male ones.  Here we go:

#Biden: Way too old.
#Sanders: Way too old.
#ORourke: Can't even beat Ted freaking Cruz.
#Buttigieg: Too perfect.
#Booker: Not enough personality.
Looking forward to @AnaKasparian being excluded from #Buttigieg interview on #tyttheconversation after her episode about him on #NOFILTER airs next week #notsayinganythingjustsaying #tytlive
He‚Äôs gay so thus progressive even though he LITERALLY has no policies! Anyone but Bernie campaign hard at work #tytlive #Buttigieg
I look at #Buttigieg and I think of Peter Griffins ‚Äúyes man‚Äù he‚Äôll tell you anythingyou want to hear if it makes you happy to hear it and that‚Äôs fine....for a small town mayor but I need a bit more meat if you want to be President! #tytlive
He has 0 policies 0 he literally said that other dem candidates spend too much time on policy!! if you‚Äôve got nothing GET OUT!!! #Buttigieg #tytlive
@cnn said that #Buttigieg is having a moment because after his town hall he made 600k in donations....but made no mention about Bernie‚Äôs 6M ....however spent half a day talking about Betos 6.1M.... wait I‚Äôve seen this movie before ‚Äò16 the remake!! #tytlive
@FogBelter @JoeBiden I posted about Biden because I felt a rebuttal to trumps smear campaign was necessary.  Trump will leave a cancerous legacy and I prefer to see someone without a political past.  I cast my first ballot in 1964. #Buttigieg is intelligent, personable, a visionary. I hope he wins.
@DineshDSouza @TheDemocrats @JoeBiden Have you heard of #Buttigieg a white male, or #Beto another white male ??
@PoldyBloom1922 @kevoboyle @IrishTimes Would have been nice if #Buttigieg had name checked Molly Bloom too, in referencing Ulysses. The book celebrates immigrants and women as much as one man, Leo. Glad that @LeoVaradkar at least began the blessed tome...
Definitely the best part of this Friday!! #Pete2020 #Buttigieg #PeteForAmerica #BlueWave2020 #PeteButtigieg2020 #MayorPete https://t.co/qk0clIe0eW
Where are #Beto2020 taxes? What about #KamalaHarris taxes? #Buttigieg taxes?

Meanwhile #Bernie2020 taxes comin on April 15

The Joe #Biden Hit https://t.co/uWfmt1VMkL #politics #bernie #beto #buttigieg
He's NOT a progressive! He's an elite neoliberal with heavy neocon leanings! 

A gentrifier in the extreme, #Buttigieg doesn't even pretend he's for justice!

Ask African-Americans and Latinos in South Bend!

What a scammer!

So far this is the best person for the 2020 job. #Buttigieg https://t.co/3al0elN4zp
Interesting piece on the draw of #Buttigieg. Still making up my own mind.  https://t.co/LF1kuHjahy
The discussion shouldn‚Äôt be about Pete #Buttigieg and #Ulysses, or even that Norwegian novel he read. The discussion should be about why liberals are always set so aflutter by candidates who read a lot and write eloquently. Is it nice? Sure. But nothing to do with leading.
@washingtonpost If Democrats aren‚Äôt willing to listen to #Buttigieg why would any non-Dem ever vote for any of them? They want a dictator.
#Buttigieg‚Äôs slipper moment. Here's my take. @PostOpinions https://t.co/r0PM4rJgK6
#Buttigieg Ein Shooting-Star der #Demokraten? https://t.co/N6tbHdGGDm Klingt jedenfalls vern√ºnftig und mitf√ºhlend. https://t.co/OI2PLUnnih
#Buttigieg is trying to avoid the wrath of a #Clinton machine that cannot accept any criticism of Secretary Clinton. All internal accounts of the 2016 Clinton campaign agree that #Hillary was ill-served by her own inability to provide a sellable reason for why she should be prez. https://t.co/odPTQzhVUk
Voting for #Buttigieg @ColmFaulkner @kevoboyle? "Buttigieg¬†described Ulysses¬†as the greatest work of modern English literature" How did #Ulysses become a talking point in the US election? (via @IrishTimes) https://t.co/RQjtDPPk5V
Excellente animation illustrant l'√©volution des recherches Google sur les actuelles candidatures aux primaires d√©mocrates. On y voit notamment le ph√©nom√®ne #Buttigieg et la relative perte de vitesse de Kamala Harris, pr√©sent√©e comme favorite il y a qq semaines encore... https://t.co/dcW9Eq5igI
@JohnLeguizamo Excuse me, haven't you got that backwards?  I would be OK with #KamalaHarris asking #Buttigieg to be her VP when she wins the nomination.
Pete #Buttigieg stresses empathy for #Trump voters. #Democrats may not want to hear it. -- This is not embracing Trump's hate but acknowledge #America had problems before Trump &amp; we need to speak to those issues as well as the problems Trump has caused.

https://t.co/nGxnksTRxB
#Buttigieg told the New Yorker recently. ‚ÄúBecause the system really had let them down, in the sense that, you know, the rising tide rose, just as we were promised it would, but most of our boats didn‚Äôt budge.‚Äù
https://t.co/nGxnksTRxB
Maybe instead of choosing by policy platform we just choose a president by their favorite book. As a former English major, this has some appeal. Meanwhile... Real things happen. #buttigieg #ulysses https://t.co/dTlLgfszq9 via @charlesfinch https://t.co/xnO9QiDFat
"He's also tangled in the city's costliest court battle ever, in which his administration is fighting the¬†release of illegally made¬†recordings of police officers' phone conversations that news reports have described as racially charged." #Buttigieg https://t.co/GbXlnfNXu5
I had an alliterative political premonition this week: President Pete! #PresidentPete! #Buttigieg  #2020Election #Democratic #DRC
#Buttigieg lauds Israeli security policies, including building barrier walls to Bantuize the West Bank &amp; shooting teenagers for throwing rocks, as "very intentional, very serious, and very effective"

So, worse than Trump

Yet nearly all my gay friends are just gaga about him

@notcapnamerica #Buttigieg has NO experience  to be president of the USA. I know #gay people like him but people have to have much more than something you have in common. #Trump should of shown people #Experience matters. This is not high school president.
@JohnLeguizamo Why not Harris2020 and #Buttigieg as vice?
The similarities between Obama‚Äôs ‚ÄúDreams from my Father‚Äù, and Buttigieg‚Äôs ‚ÄúShortest Way Home‚Äù are striking. Both read like novels, have a dry sense of humor, and are always placing their lived-experience in the context of broader political and economic change. #Obama #Buttigieg
After #Gaza slaughter, #Buttigieg, former Navy Intel oficer, praised Israeli security responses as 'moving' and faulted Democrats for easy judgment

‚ÄúRather than forge a pol¬≠icy com¬≠pro¬≠mise with Republicans, Mayor #Buttigieg wants to trans¬≠form ideas &amp; structures that define American politics. If #Sanders is a class warrior, Pete Buttigieg is a partisan warrior‚Äù ~

OK. Gelezen. In deze context geen probleem, ook voor mij, onderdeel van ‚Äòn ethnische minderheid. #Buttigieg blijft voorlopig, samen met Andrew #Yang, mijn favoriet voor de Democratische nominatie (zo lang #AOC nog te jong is om te mogen meedoen). https://t.co/1vq78GXiqO
Today I learned that #Buttigieg has a cognate in Arabic meaning Father of Chickens and if that doesn't mean he's destined to lead the Democrats I don't know what is?
Also, he need to work this GoT angle. Mother of Dragons; Father of Chickens...no?
