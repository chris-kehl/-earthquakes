@vexedinthecity @ezraklein Apparently @vexedinthecity you haven’t read about #Buttigieg’s credentials. He’s rather brainy, a self taught multilinguist, a military vet, well traveled, experienced mayor, empathetic and thoughtful among other traits. Maybe read before you tweet? #SundayMotivation
@AnandWrites A/ #Buttigieg or #Kamala B/ Bernie C/ no clue until after debates - democrats find braininess a requirement.

As much as I ♥ the speech by #Buttigieg.. I just don't think the country is ready to hand over the keys to the wheels to a 37 yr old. I hope I'm wrong cause he'll make a good president.

McKinsey Pete's for democracy when it comes to overturning Citizens United, but not when it involves criticizing his corp lobbyist friends' support for the pvt over the common good. Nor does he say much abt the role the billionaire class plays in subverting democracy.

There is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word 'Again' - #Buttigieg 

#PeteForAmerica
#Buttigieg: “I’m here to tell a different story than Make America Great Again.

I recognize the audacity.

But we live in a moment that compels each of us to act. This time it’s not about winning an election. It’s about winning an ERA.”

Mayor Pete #Buttigieg isn't my first choice but I'm happy he's running.  His candidacy morally elevates our whole country.  Inevitably, if it were #WarrenButttigieg2020, I would be happy and relieved.
Pete is killing it! #PeteForAmerica #Buttigieg #buttigieg2020

Interesting contrast between yesterday's #Booker rally in Newark and today's #Buttigieg rally in South Bend. Booker's was long on color and diversity. Buttieg's is monochromatic.
Under Bill Clinton, the presidency was downgraded to a super-sized governor (read to school kids, sign symbolic bills in Rose Garden). Would #Buttigieg downgrade it further -- to super-sized mayor?

I'm sorry, But I cannot have a President with a last name that I can't pronounce.. #Buttigieg Buttishmeig. Whatever. Bye.
The more I hear from #Buttigieg, more he's my choice for POTUS. But I'm afraid too many moderate Dems will be put off by the idea of a FMOTUS, instead of FLOTUS. Big shame. #lgbtq
#Buttigieg's eagerness to discuss his #religiosity heartens some, but for #atheists &amp; others who fully support the rationale of the #EstablishmentClause it can be worrisome. We've been fighting #theocracy in this country a long time.
Interesting thought just said on MSNBC: Was #Buttigieg's #Buttigieg2020 announcement delayed today because his team knew he'd be competing with the major breaking news about #Tiger and #TheMasters?

Ignorance on #Buttigieg record is dangerous
@jdforward Obviously @AIPAC knows nothing about #MayorPete stealing 600+ inherited homes from Black South Bend families forcing them to pay $9000 each when he tore their homes down.  Try vetting candidates before endorsing them. #Buttigieg is a failed mayor who wanted to take a STRH8 pill.

Opinions on who’s getting ‘more coverage’ are highly subjective.
@chickxcoffee I’m lovin’bout 6-Dem candidates right now; #Buttigieg, more and more.
PLEASE, PLEASE, stop fretting over who’s leading or who’s ‘slighted.’

What bothers me isn't #Buttigieg claiming his right to define his own Christian narrative, it's that he's using his religion to justify his politics. That's just as bad as fundamentalists.  I don't care if he poops gay rainbows. Keep your Sky God out of my government. https://t.co/uO26902uYW

Biden and Bernie have 100% name recognition but only 25%
Buttigieg has 25% but has risen exponentionally. Harris and Warren are next.

So much so that when I had a viral tweet of #Gillibrand actually speaking Mandarin (she studied in China), #Buttigieg supporters told me to "stop making things up" to promote Gillibrand.
Uh, it was an actual video.

This doesn't look good for #Warren.
While she raised $6M, putting her on par with #Kllobuchar and just below #Buttigieg, she blew through 85% of it.

I'm surprised #Trump didn't give #Buttigieg nickname yet. I'm thinking mr. Rogers  whenever I see him on TV. #MAGA

@HelloWhiteLotus @GeorgeTakei @briannanichols @Bandinellosaul Yes, unfortunately, we're living in the idiocracy.

I can see a debate now: #Buttigieg is engaged in an interesting exposition about wage disparity, and Trump rips a big fart and 60million #MAGAts laugh and blow up Twitter saying, "TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP!"

If you watch #Buttigieg w/ #EllenDegeneres notice how only one audience member applauds for him fighting in #Afghanistan &amp; it is awkward... then Ellen directs the audience to clap there’s full applause, on command. Hilarious. Sad.

No one loves war deep down but people are sheep https://t.co/1BBMtHzEvA
So, #Buttigieg’s South Bend is such a mess of de-industrialized #poverty &amp; rising low wage #policestate, that it makes #Obama’s #Chicago look nice.

Wake up America! #EllenDegeneres shouldn’t get to crown someone President because of their charming personality.

@mog7546 Pence and his religion is a tar baby that #Buttigieg would be wise not to allow to entrap him. It is an unimportant side issue that is not what draws voters to the Mayor.

But "laws" can also be easily hidden behind as justification to not do the right thing. This is what King was addressing. How does this relate to #Buttigieg ? When he said "all lives matter" he was also hiding behind "the law" to avoid releasing tapes that directly 4/
Everyone's focused on #Buttigieg 's  "all lives matter" comment. He's going to get a pass from the media and white progressives because "he's learned and stopped saying it". But has the thinking underneath changed? This is what #MLK spoke about in re: white "moderates" 1/ https://t.co/3bqCkApix8
So #Buttigieg was more concerned with "the law" which in this case was more concerned with protecting the police engaged in racism ( some would argue and I'd agree, working as designed) than addressing the racism. And this is also what #MLK spoke about 6/
This is the type of voter #Buttigieg thinks is reachable.

Takes two to feud! #Buttigieg
#Buttigieg's very public "faith"
--actually, self-righteous legalism using a system he created

Like Jefferson, he cuts what he doesn't like out of the Bible
UNLIKE Jefferson he  &amp; LGBT have no tolerance
for FREE EXERCISE of others' religion--&gt;#EqualityAct

Intriguing. #Buttigieg identifies with a faith that defines his lifestyle choice (not orientation) as sin, yet he sees his duty to criticize others in their faith.

A "midwestern mayor, Rhodes Scholar, and war veteran who..cites St Augustine as a religious influence is running for president. He’s a Democrat..criticizing the current president, a Republican, for infidelity and lack of family values. And he’s gay." 
~@Peter_Wehner on #Buttigieg
@thehill She overstated "attack". Perhaps she should look inward if she felt attacked. Buttigieg entitled to give his opinion.

@PeteButtigieg #Buttigieg is working on many stories that he and his staff are fabricating as part of his strategy. A strategy @TheDemocrats have advised him to pursue. “Make the lies believable” is the objective.

@sevnthstar @PeteButtigieg he was not considered civil at the time.  most white people considered him far from 'polite'.  aka: uppity, divisive, "social justice warrior" and all those words and devices that are used to silence the marginalized.  PS #Buttigieg uses "SJW" himself. #privilege.

Caitlyn Jenner is bad for LGBT Americans.
Pete #Buttigieg is not. And a major publication calling him “bad for the gays,” is wildly inappropriate. 

There is no “correct” way to be queer in the public eye.
@RealSaavedra ...tough to take #Buttigieg seriously about this, when his father was a Marxist professor who praised the Communist manifesto...
@RealSaavedra #Buttigieg looks ridiculous fighting the faux #Pence boogeyman. He’s using faith as a tool to garner Trump votes, hoping #Christians are too stupid to reconcile his religious hypocrisy on late term #abortion.

@CNN @VP has only EVER shown @PeteButtigieg RESPECT &amp; #Buttigieg disgraces himself with hollow false accusations of @VP because he lacks any real policy positions! #MAGA @POTUS #WakeUpAmerica!
How to interpret the #DemocraticPrimary rankings:

#Biden is a proxy for white Dem good-will toward Obama.

#Sanders' lack of dominance means he is no longer the standard-bearer for millennial socialism.

#Booker is the progressive dark horse.

#Buttigieg is VP.

The rest are DOA https://t.co/hjqHllF4tc
Well #Buttigieg? Got a clear and logical answer? https://t.co/y2SJjTML9c
@thehill Are you condemning #VicePresident #Pence  #religious beliefs? That aside, please point out in the #Bible where it says the VP is incorrect. #Buttigieg
@thehill #Buttigieg - stop attacking a man who chooses to follow the #Bible as written not as interpreted by modern societal standards. If you believe the Bible doesn't apply to your lifestyle then take it up with #God , don't blame other #Christians !
Mayor Pete #Buttigieg #Buttigieg2020  - Why does he want to make this campaign about #sexual preference and #Religion ? It appears he would rather attack #Christians who believe the #Bible is the standard for #moral conduct, not the wants of modern #society.  #politics #LGBTQ

#Buttigieg: After Trump elected POTUS, “I added to our mayor’s office to-do list the creation of a phone tree in the event of immigration raids.”
When #Buttigieg met Mike Pence, he was ‘surprised by how affable, even gentle he seemed.’ Their ‘long and complicated relationship’ began when Pence was sworn in as Governor in 2013. #ShortestWayHome THREAD
@ShannonBream Give all Christains a break regarding LGBT. #Buttigieg. Mayor since you openly say your a member of that community The BIBLE and GOD clearly says marriage is between a man and woman. You must not be reading the same Bible I am. I am a sinner but I ask forgiveness.
I'd say 9yo transgender kids performing late night in gay bars is DEFINITELY a societal collapse coming straight out of the LGBTQ culture.

#FoxNews #Buttigieg
There is something off with #Buttigieg . I am not buying his BS.
Democratic convention  is July 2020. Candidate vetting will occur throughout. Yes, #Buttigieg is being sued, but there's no outcome to date.

Sounds like Peter has the problem. But surprise. 😒
Should #Buttigieg win the nomination (not withstanding the presidency, given the subject), this speech on his sexuality will be looked in the same light as #JFK's speech to the Protestants in Houston on his Catholicism or #Obama's post-Jeremiah Wright speech on race. https://t.co/8lqBcnrR3S
"#Buttigieg couldn’t wrap his mind around how evangelical voters could tolerate the President." https://t.co/l1PTYtPG5P But Trump knows it's all about #Abortions.

Having lived at an IN university for 1.5 years and with parents now living there, I agree.

Speaking my language. we need to vote #Buttigieg in 2020 for #POTUS. https://t.co/vDlkWAPprX
@EWErickson #Buttigieg is a typical #democrat. He is using #Christian faith to promote his own #political agenda and the bonus is he can drag in someone like @VP who is trying to live his faith, not create it.
@sherrilee7 His comments brought tears to my eyes, paralleling the experience / fears of someone very close to me raised in a Christian home. I hope people see him for the views and person he is, what he can bring to the table, not just solely carrying the label of his sexuality #Buttigieg
@thehill So why does the Bible say men don't sleep with men? #Buttigieg
@GrettaGoodis @MSNBC So you’ve seen #Buttigieg’a taxes?
@WBrant6 @SnowBla92173186 @BariAWilliams My point was that the PRESS coverage of #Buttigieg is in part driven by a non diverse press corps who often romanticize someone who's resume isn't radically different than Booker for example. The same press that calls Pete Brilliant but calls women like Warren a "scold"
Tremendous segment today on 
@NicolleDWallace’s Deadline:White House about #Buttigieg’s awesome Sunday speech about being gay. His compelling authenticity resonated w/Wallace, who is comfortable w/her life as an ex-GOP politico.
Hm, interesting points about #Buttigieg. I haven't seen charisma from him that makes me think others' praise of him is worthy... yet. I may need to see more, but right now I'm still more excited by &amp; impressed by some of the female candidates. https://t.co/Gj6QrTrzLe
Hey @MSNBC

#buttigieg please do not make being gay your campaign campaign.  No identity politics anymore.  Please please.  I will not vote for you if you think I'm going to vote for you because you're gay. I'm lesbian I will not go for you just because you're gay.

1/2 As a completely committed #Beto2020 supporter, I find the #MayorPete candidacy incredibly compelling. I absolutely will be campaigning/supporting #BetoFor46 but both #Buttigieg &amp; #Beto have a multitude of values/qualities/perspectives that I genuinely admire.
2/2 #Beto &amp; #Buttigieg know that mobilizing an inspired citizenry to exercise a collective voice combined w/real structural change are the only pathways to transformational policies ever being enacted. Values/Systemic Thinking &gt; Utopian Policy Positions https://t.co/gZz24MxUnZ
1/2 #Beto &amp; #Buttigieg are both spot on about philosophy/values preceding #policy prescriptions. Ideologues=BlueSkyThinking if they believe campaign policy papers will ever become an unaltered reality. We live in a divided democracy not in an absolute monarchy #NoMagicWandsInUSA

If you want to disagree with #Buttigieg on policy that is fine, he is not my first choice, but can we avoid making fun of his name especially with what can be considered gay slurs
Mr #Buttigieg has a lot to say about "#DemocraticCapitalism," but he seems to be clueless about the ideas of the great and wise man who actually wrote a book on the subject more than 30 years ago:   https://t.co/3cJapjA0XG

I was pretty much over #Buttigieg from day one, but in the past week or so, he has firmly placed himself on my “Nah” list. From his BS about Trump supporters to the white working class line to his advocacy for “democratic capitalism,” I’m just too thru. https://t.co/nO0yTbkg3n

Some of y'all want a #Buttigieg presidency, but can't intelligently discuss his politics. 

I wonder why. 🤔
#Buttigieg’s speech blew my mind.  I’m in - he’s brilliant, kind and honest.
@kylegriffin1 @PeteButtigieg is taking the necessary steps to appropriately question the stranglehold the right believes it has on moral authority and the use of that authority to marginalize Americans .  It’s an important, much needed debate .  #PeteButtigieg #Buttigieg #2020Election #LGBTQ
@kylegriffin1 #Buttigieg choses men over women? Good for him. More lovelies for the rest of us...😃 who cares...
@DRUDGE This is too perfect, break down those walls #Buttigieg #Decision2019
@NolteNC @BreitbartNews Doesn't God (and medical doctors) say that men should not use their lower digestive tract as a sexual organ?  #Buttigieg needs to get right with God before attacking others.
"#Kerry’s campaign serves best, perhaps, as an object lesson in what parts of the Kennedy legacy—the looks, the accent ... —have diminished in significance over time, and which remain evergreen: youth, vigor, a sense of high purpose." https://t.co/45VJr5mfqW #Beto #Buttigieg

#Buttigieg: 'I Would Have Done Anything to Not Be Gay'

https://t.co/iLwFKpBdif

I'd do anything not to be a disabled black lesbian...oh wait...I'm not.

🙄
#Buttigieg His abnormal sexual orientation is more of a threat than Global Warming.  The more people who go untreated for this psycho disorder and the more its normalized by our society, the more likely humans go extinct in the future.  His lastname would bring endless jokes.
#Buttigieg Americans are not going to put two more gay men in the White House; even after admitting it up front.  They have a psychological disorder and the sooner people realize that the sooner we can help people like them.   Lusting over the same sex is abnormal behavior.
#Buttigieg out for me, way too religious. I have had more than enough of the nonsense in our countries leaders.
@benshapiro #Buttigieg Worrying about Mike Pence’s personal beliefs is not a national agenda. He isn’t making his the national religion.

@Pappiness His whole speech was remarkably touching &amp; poignant &amp; brutally honest. The fact he could share his very personal story (&amp; his love for his husband) speaks volumes for him as a man &amp; the President he would be.

From it: "... He is, quite simply, what many of us in my generation of gays fought for and rarely believed could happen: He is proud to be gay but not defined by it, happily married, a veteran, wickedly smart, and completely integrated."

3. The Laws of the OT need the WHOLE of the Covenant. For example, if Trump prevented Muslims from exercising their religious beliefs, #Buttigieg would conclude he's "oppressing" the "strangers," but OT Israel would prevent this.

Israel's Torah protected their social order.
1. Buttigieg confuses Church &amp; the State, although I'm sure he'd appeal to their separation. 

2. The State exists to execute wrath on evil doers/reward the good, not "wash feet," administer grace, esp via other peoples money, in the world.

@JYSexton Already begun. The coverage of #Beto and #Buttigieg, #Bernie and #Biden is out-of-balance compared with the coverage of the women candidates. We need a watchdog to keep track of each candidate's #media coverage, and call out the media for the disparity.
@MeetThePress Nothing like watching two #Communists like @chucktodd and @PeteButtigieg toss the hammer and sickle back and forth to kickstart a #SundayMorning, with no challenge from #ChuckTodd to #Buttigieg’s policies or support of #ICE &amp; U.S. immigration laws. #NoTimRussert

@DonnaFiducia People keep saying #Buttigieg is some kind of “moderate” because he is young, pleasant, articulate, and doesn’t flail and jump around like #Beto. But he is every bit as radical #Left on so many key issues. That may make him more dangerous. Media ADORES #MayorPete right now.

Agreed. Saying that #Buttigieg isn’t gay enough or that #Harris isn’t black enough is just what Republican voters thought when they were looking for someone who was white enough to be president. Then Trump. We need people, not stereotypes, in office https://t.co/1StmCTdGud
@JohnLeguizamo Not Harris. She's sent nearly (every) single black person "up the road," even for petty crimes, drug addiction, mj... And she gives into the Nazi compliance way too often for my liking. I want us to progress not take baby steps. Lives are on the line.

Looking forward to @AnaKasparian being excluded from #Buttigieg interview on #tyttheconversation after her episode about him on #NOFILTER airs next week #notsayinganythingjustsaying #tytlive
He’s gay so thus progressive even though he LITERALLY has no policies! Anyone but Bernie campaign hard at work #tytlive #Buttigieg
I look at #Buttigieg and I think of Peter Griffins “yes man” he’ll tell you anythingyou want to hear if it makes you happy to hear it and that’s fine....for a small town mayor but I need a bit more meat if you want to be President! #tytlive
He has 0 policies 0 he literally said that other dem candidates spend too much time on policy!! if you’ve got nothing GET OUT!!! #Buttigieg #tytlive
@cnn said that #Buttigieg is having a moment because after his town hall he made 600k in donations....but made no mention about Bernie’s 6M ....however spent half a day talking about Betos 6.1M.... wait I’ve seen this movie before ‘16 the remake!! #tytlive
@FogBelter @JoeBiden I posted about Biden because I felt a rebuttal to trumps smear campaign was necessary.  Trump will leave a cancerous legacy and I prefer to see someone without a political past.  I cast my first ballot in 1964. #Buttigieg is intelligent, personable, a visionary. I hope he wins.
@DineshDSouza @TheDemocrats @JoeBiden Have you heard of #Buttigieg a white male, or #Beto another white male ??
@PoldyBloom1922 @kevoboyle @IrishTimes Would have been nice if #Buttigieg had name checked Molly Bloom too, in referencing Ulysses. The book celebrates immigrants and women as much as one man, Leo. Glad that @LeoVaradkar at least began the blessed tome...

The discussion shouldn’t be about Pete #Buttigieg and #Ulysses, or even that Norwegian novel he read. The discussion should be about why liberals are always set so aflutter by candidates who read a lot and write eloquently. Is it nice? Sure. But nothing to do with leading.

@JohnLeguizamo Excuse me, haven't you got that backwards?  I would be OK with #KamalaHarris asking #Buttigieg to be her VP when she wins the nomination.
Pete #Buttigieg stresses empathy for #Trump voters. #Democrats may not want to hear it. -- This is not embracing Trump's hate but acknowledge #America had problems before Trump &amp; we need to speak to those issues as well as the problems Trump has caused.

#Buttigieg told the New Yorker recently. “Because the system really had let them down, in the sense that, you know, the rising tide rose, just as we were promised it would, but most of our boats didn’t budge.”

OK. Gelezen. In deze context geen probleem, ook voor mij, onderdeel van ‘n ethnische minderheid. #Buttigieg blijft voorlopig, samen met Andrew #Yang, mijn favoriet voor de Democratische nominatie (zo lang #AOC nog te jong is om te mogen meedoen). https://t.co/1vq78GXiqO

Also, he need to work this GoT angle. Mother of Dragons; Father of Chickens...no?
